#SVJelly
A library for turning a SVG file into a physically simulated scene.

###Work in progress
SVJelly is a work in progress and can be rough on the edges. The api is subject to break.
It is physics engine-agnostic but has a built-in 'physics renderer' working with P2js.
There is a built-in graphics renderer too, but interfacing the lib with your renderer should be easy.

##How to use it ?
Basically, the lib turns any SVG, weither you wrote it by hand or generated it from Illustrator or other vector drawing softwares that can export svg files (I couldn't test every program unfortunately) into a 'scene' on a canvas.
All your drawings, by default, will result in non-physical drawings on the canvas. 

###Physical objects
The magic happens when you start giving keyword-based names to your objects or groups. This can be done in Illustrator by altering the name of your layers or groups, or by hand with the ID attribute.
The ID attribute of your svg element can be a simple keyword : 'metal' or 'wood' will turn your object into a moving object with the properties of the material you used as a keyword.
Soft bodies are included too ! That means you can create trees, ropes, jelly, etc. That was the starting idea for the lib and that is where the name comes from.
You can either name the shape itself or a group containing various shapes, if you name a group containing several shapes, every shape will take the properties of the material you specified for the group.
The ID attribute can be of the form 'objectType-objectIdentifier' : it lets you define a type for the object AND an identifier for later reference. This is important for constraints.

###Constraints
You create a constraint by putting the object you want to constrain in a group, and add an other polygonal shape that you will call 'constraint' in the same group. Think of it as a selection tool. Any of the anchors of your object that are overlapping with this vector shape will be constrained. If you want your object to be attached to another object you name your constraint shape 'constraint-otherObjectIdentifier'

###Joints
Joints behave like constraint, but they are links that bond the nodes of a soft body together. You can use them to create for example muscles that you can control programmatically. They only work if you use a simple `<line>` connecting the two anchors you want to link. The syntax for the name of a joint is 'joint-jointType'

###Config file
You can fine-tune your objects or create new type of objects by creating a JSON config file with the properties of your objects and scene. Check out the examples to have an idea of what you can do with a config file.

###Limitations
For non-moving shapes, you are quite free to draw curves, gradients, strokes, etc.
Moving shapes can only be simple paths with simple strokes at the moment. curves are not supported apart from circles. Gradients on moving shapes are not supported yet apart from lines with gradients.

##Config file reference

- **worldWidth** : Specifies the physical width of your scene.
- **multiCanvas** : If true, the renderer will create multiple canvas for the layers of your scene. Helps improving performances.
- **debug** : If true, a debug view of your scene will be displayed.
- **gravity** : The gravitational force, represented as an array with two entries.
- **groups** : The properties of your physical objects. (See objects reference).
- **definition** : Definition of the canvas element. Fraction of 1.

##Built-in objects reference

- **metal** : Hard body
- **stone** : Hard body
- **wood** : Hard body
- **balloon** : Hard body, can lift other objects
- **tree** : Soft body, the mass of the nodes decrease the farer you go from the fixed points. The linking of the nodes composing the shape will be created from triangulation.
- **flora** : Basically the same as the tree object but for line drawings.
- **jelly** : A soft body whose structure is an hexagonal grid.
- **rope** : Another soft body that emulates a rope, the more nodes your line drawing have, the more ropey it will look.
- **static** : A hard body that doesn't move but will collide with other objects
- **noCollide** : A hard body whose collisions won't be registered. 
- **leaves** : A body that won't collide and can be useful to emulate leaves for the tree object.

##Future plans
- motors, springs, built-in muscles etc. 
- an option to have moving shapes with gradients
- "decorations" for moving objects, stuff that is drawn but isn't involved into collisions.
- Pixi renderer based on sprites but I have yet to solve a fast way to include soft shapes.
- A renderer with a viewport and a camera but I have no idea how to implement this correctly performance-wise
